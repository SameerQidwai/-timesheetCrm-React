LEAVEREQUEST.js
    Don't call api's over and over.. 
    if you edit a sinlge entry edit in local yourself on response of patch api

    use Hooks less: try to change state in less setState

    Don't need to call api for onClose Modal instead create a single callback function for edit and add entry and a function for close

AddRequestModal.js
    try to use less variable like as per edit you can look dataReceived variable and set the condition on it isntead of create a new variable "isEditAble"
