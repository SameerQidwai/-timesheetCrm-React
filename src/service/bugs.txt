Update and check 
    Leave Requets ERRORs
        Error on index leave request api,
        I am also unable to submit leave application for the date when my leave application has already been rejected ...
        if I am selecting single date...(Rejected already for the leave request) 
            (so my concern is single date might not be checking if leave request already submitted or not)
                dateEroro
         status condition. (from backend)
        can you please add one more boolean key of reSubmission in this error please?

        I am unable to check edit leave
            (concern that you are also checking this editing Leave request so it will also throw error)
    backend: [
        Leave_request not adding again when rejected,
        Backend unknown Errors and showing...
    ]
