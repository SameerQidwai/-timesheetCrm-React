I am not getting milestone Id when creating timebase 
so this means the milestone is not creating by default

//timeSheet.js file deleted will be in commit   17-11 before 5
// userContent.js file is deleted will be in commit 17-11 before 5
//TimeSheetHTMLs  file is deleted will be in commit 17-11 before 5
